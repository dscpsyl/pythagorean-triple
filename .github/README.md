# Pythagorean Triple

A simple python script that take two numbers and gives out a Pythagorean Triple. Learn more about why this works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJYmyhnaaek). Inspired by the same video.

## Getting Started

This script will run with most verison of python2 and python3. However, python 3 is recomended.

### Prerequisites

- Python3.6>= (RECOMENDED)
- Numpy

### Installing

Clone the repository and enter it. 

## Usage

1. `python3 pythagorean-triple.py`
2. On screen instruction will guide you through the script process.

### Limitations

1. The two numbers cannot be the same. This will give out a useless triple. 
2. The second number cannot be even. This will also give out a useless triple. 
3. This will not find every individual pythagorean triple. It will howver find at least one of every multiple. 

Again, refer back to the included video for why this happens.
