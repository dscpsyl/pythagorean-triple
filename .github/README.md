# Pythagorean Triple
A simple python script that take two numbers and gives out a Pythagorean Triple.

---
This is just a simple script that gives back a Pythagorean triple. You can learn more about why this works with this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJYmyhnaaek).

## Limitations
Of course, there are limitations to this. 

1. The two numbers cannot be the same. This will give out a useless triple. 
2. The second number cannot be even. This will also give out a useless triple. 

Again, refer back to the included video for why this happens. 

## How to use

Just clone this repository and run the included script. It's literally less than 30 lines of code. You can figure it out.
